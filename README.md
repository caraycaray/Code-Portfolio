The following are assignments and projects completed during my time at Duke's Fuqua School of Business and University of Colorado Denver. Below are brief descriptions of each folder's content.

## Analyzing and Predicting NBA Basketball Shots, 2019

Used Random Forest modeling and K-Mean clustering in R to determine which position each player should focus on to increase team expected points, and analyze how each player performed compared to league. Recommended positions into which teams should hire more players.

## Analyzing Suicide for Comprehension and Prevention, 2018

Dissected, interpreted, and presented data "Suicide Rates Overview 1985 to 2016" from World Health Organization (WHO). Identified and analyzed important candidate variables influencing suicide count: sex, gross domestic product, and year. Recommended actions to reduce suicide rates.

The dataset aims at discovering the important candidates, and measuring their impacts for suicide count in order to make suggestions on suicide prevention in the future. To study the research question, I chose a database called Suicide Rates Overview 1985 to 2016 from the World Health Organization (2018), obtained from Kaggle (Rusty 2018, December 01) and did data cleaning and mining. The data compares socio-economic information with suicide rates by year and country. The compiled set of data was built to find signals correlated with increased suicide rates among different cohorts globally, across the socio-economic spectrum, with a goal of inspiring suicide prevention.

## Examining Robbery Rates within Public Infrastructure in Denver, 2018

Used Generalized Linear Model in R and gave data-driven policy proposals including improving bike rack construction quality, and educating bike owners to sufficiently lock bikes. Identified and advocated for policies elevating community voices and concerns.

## Analyzing ESOP Performance, 2017

Assessed Return on Investment stock price data based on control groups. Predicted ESOP’s positive effect on semi-annual stock price performance for listed company Shenzhen Sunsea Communication, as a medium-term investment. Co-authored academic journal, published in school academic periodical ISBN: 978-7-5655-1921-5, Summer 2017.

## Combined Tidy Starbucks Dataset, 2017

Starbucks had quickly established itself as a premium coffee brand after initially launching in the 1970s. It’s exponential growth and expansion during the 1990s and the early 2000s had made the brand an instant classic for business school case studies globally and had remained as the market leader in multiple industries and market sectors even as of today. 

As business school students from a top school, despite not having direct access to Starbucks's internal data, our team is still interested in understanding key factors that influences Starbucks’ strategic decision with its business. We have found a location dataset of Starbucks stores last updated in 2017 and have decided to gather more associated data in order to build a larger dataset for understanding, modeling and forecasting Starbuck’s current and future business strategy within the United States.

## Sentiment and Network Analysis of Starbucks

we are interested in how Twitter users think about the world’s largest coffee company: Starbucks. By using sentiment and network analysis, we will try to answer the questions below: 

-	What kind of topics related to Starbucks are twitter users talking about?

-	What are consumers’ attitudes towards Starbucks?

-	Are there some complaints from customers? If so, what are they?

-	How can Starbucks improve its customer services?

-	Are there some marketing opportunities on twitter?

To answer these questions, we extract 1200 tweets using Twitter API through R and  then perform the analysis, visualize results and draw conclusions.
